				<h2>About Supreme Overlord Tyrant Queen Kimmy Kim, Mother of Forklifts</h2>
				
				<p>Supreme Overlord Tyrant Queen Kimmy Kim, Mother of Forklifts has been our fair ruler since the country's inception in 2014. She rose to power immediately after sitting on the barren land and puffing. This puff later became our national anthem. Without her guidance, this country would not be prestigious and prosperous. She has personally carried out over 1500 executions since becoming Supreme Overlord Tyrant Queen Kimmy Kim, more than Texas!</p>
				
				<p>Born in the ICOP, she was a reserved child with a keen interest in finance, accounting and rice cakes. Her love of rice cakes escalated to a point where she studied them day and night and found that they had incredible power. She used this power to carve out a slice of the world and as an artist would, use it as her canvas. From this place, the illegal country of puff was founded. She has been personally involved in every construction and technology project, executing half of the workers for each one. She graduated from the UICOP in 2016 with her B.S. in Finance. Her surviving classmates describe her as studious, structured and menacing (please don't execute me).</p>
				
				<p>When she studied rice cakes, she learned that they could be used to create buildings. Using sushi as the foundation for the buildings, she was able to create cities of skyscrapers made of rice cakes. The first project using this discovery was the city's capital, where she is housed and executes people. Another city she created had been created only of sushi. This is where most of the executed population lives and are buried.</p>
